# deepfake_image_detection

**deepfake_image_detection** is a Python package designed to detect deepfake images using state-of-the-art deep learning models powered by PyTorch and transformers. This package provides an easy-to-use API to classify images as real or fake, making it a valuable tool in the fight against misinformation and digital fraud.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install deepfake_image_detection
```

## Usage

### Classify an Image from a URL

You can classify whether an image is real or fake directly from a URL using the `classify_image_from_url` function.

```python
from deepfake_image_detection import classify_image_from_url

# Example usage
image_url = "https://www.chambermusicarts.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cheryl-Kjm.jpeg"
result = classify_image_from_url(image_url)

if result == 0:
    print('Fake Image')
else:
    print('Real Image')
```

### Example Output

```bash
Real Image
```

## How It Works

The **deepfake_image_detection** package leverages a pre-trained deepfake detection model. The model is built using PyTorch, a deep learning framework, and transformers, a library that provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for NLP and other tasks. The package processes the input image and classifies it as either real or fake with high accuracy.
